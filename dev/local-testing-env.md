# Products local testing environment

The purpose of this environemt is to provide Products developers with a local testing environment that is identical to the one running in CI.
The same local testing environment *can be* used as a local development, but that is not its main goal.

The entrypoint to anything you will need to do will be the `tric`, for "tribeception", binary, located in the `dev` directory.

## Requirements

The stack runs based on [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/): you will need both installed and available to be able to use the local testing environment.  
If your Docker installation requires root access, please follow [this guide](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/) to make sure root access is not required to run `docker` commands.  

You should be able to run the following command without issues and without requiring root access:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

If this is not the case, please take the time to read Docker and docker-compose documentation and fix the issues you encounter.

## Preparing the plugins

The stack does not come with any plugin you need to work on, so you will have to do some work to set them up one by one, as required by your work.  

The stack will look for plugins in the `dev/test/plugins` directory, so change directory to that and clone the plugin(s) you need to work on:

```bash
cd dev/test/plugins
git clone git@github.com:moderntribe/the-events-calendar.git
cd the-events-calendar
git checkout release/B20.03
git submodule update --recursive --init
```

The last part is to build the required Composer and `npm` dependencies, to avoid misaligned dependencies, use the containers provided in the stack to update the dependencies.  
Change directory back to the `dev` directory first, then run the following command:

```bash
tric build the-events-calendar
```

Give the whole process some time to complete and do the same for each plugin you need to work on.

## Running tests

To run tests using this local testing environment use the `tric` binary contained in the `dev` directory.  

Run the `tric` command without any arguments to get an help page and a list of commands.

To run the `wpunit` suite of `the-events-calendar` plugin, as an example, use:

```bash
dev/tric use the-events-calendar
dev/tric run wpunit
```

Since the command might potentially run on any of the plugins maintained by the Products team, you'll need to tell the `tric` command what plugin you're currently working on with the `use` sub-command.
You can change the plugin you want to run tests on by using the `tric use` command again at any moment. If you want, now to run Event Tickets tests, you could just use:

```bash
dev/tric use event-tickets
dev/tric run integration
```

### Running a specific test case

If you need to run a specific test case in a suite only, you can do this using the same command you would use in Codeception:

```bash
dev/tric use event-calendar-pro
dev/tric run tests/integration/SomeTest.php
```

### Running a specific test method

If you need to run a specific test method, part of a test case, you can do this using the same command you would use in Codeception:

```bash
dev/tric use event-calendar-pro
dev/tric run tests/integration/SomeTest.php:test_foo_is_not_bar
```

## Using the shell

If you want more hands-on control on the stack, or need to access its inner workings, you can open a PHP interactive shell in it with the following command: 


```bash
dev/tric shell
```

This is a PHP interactive shell that comes pre-loaded with the Docker and docker-compose functions, it has auto-completion and requires you to write using PHP syntax.  
As an example, running `the-events-calendar` `wpunit` suite from within the interactive shell would look like this:

```shell
dev/tric shell
```

Once the interactive shell has started type the following commands:

```
tric > using_plugin('the-events-calendar')('run wpunit');
```

The command will start, with some debug output, and print the test result on screen, when the command it's done it will return to the interactive shell.
As our use of `tric` grows more and more functions will be added to the interactive shell, please take some time to explore the code to find out more.  
Or use auto-completion like a mad man and find out the hard way.

## Debugging tests with XDebug

The stack will run, by default and for performance reasons, without XDebug activated.  
You will need to debug the tests, plugin or WordPress code during your work and XDebug is the only reliable option to do so.  

If the stack is currently running you will need to tear down the stack first:


Then activate the stack debug mode:

```bash
dev/tric debug on
```
> Note: activating and deactivating the debug mode will tear down, stop and remove, the stack containers and, with them, any modification you've made to the stack. If you have valuable information (you should not) inthe stack, then save it first.

The next time you spin up the stack to run tests or to have the WordPress installation locally served, you will be able to debug the code line-by-line using the following settings in your IDE:

* Listen for XDebug connections on port 9001
* Set up path mappings:
	* `dev/tests/wordpress` -> `/var/www/html`
	* `dev/test/plugins` -> `/plugins`
* If your IDE allows it, then set the server name and host to `tric`, this is the IDE configuration key XDebug will use when communicating with your host machine.

Please refer to your IDE of choice to know how to set up these values.

> Note if you cannot set the above values in your "IDE", then your "IDE" is not an "IDE": it's a powerful and cute text editor.

When you are done with debuggin and want to deactivate it, just run this command:

```bash
dev/tric debug off
```

## Using the stack as a local development environment

This is not the stack main purpose, but it can be done as long as you're willing to work on a site served on `http://localhost`.  

You can start the stack, and have it configured for you, running the following command:

```bash
dev/tric serve 8888
```

The above command will start the stack, install a fresh copy of WordPress, set it up to look for plugins in the `dev/test/plugins` directory, and be served at `http://localhost:8888`.

You can stop the stack by running the following command:

```bash 
dev/tric down
```

### Using wp-cli in the stack

If you are using the stack as a local development environment, then you might need to interact with it using wp-cli.  
In that case you can use the `tric cli` sub-command to run any command on the stack:

```bash
dev/tric cli plugin list --status=active
dev/tric cli plugin activate the-events-calendar event-tickets
```

If you need to run any command that would modify a plugin filesystem, remember that, in the container, the plugins are located in the `/plugins` directory.  
As an example, if I wanted to dump the current database contents to the `tests/_data/dump.sql` file of `the-events-calendar` plugin, I would run this command:

```bash
tric cli db export /plugins/the-events/calendar/tests/_data/dump.sql
```

## How the stack works, an overview 

The stack services are defined by the `dev/tric.yml` file. This is a YAML format docker-compose configuration file the `tric` binary will use to run the `docker-compose` command.  
The main services defined there are:

* `wordpress` - this uses the `wordpress:latest` image, the official Docker image for WordPress. When running the container will fill the `dev/test/wordpress` directory with the contents of the WordPress installation that is currently serving the container. Furthermore the WordPress container is configured to look for plugins in the `/plugins` directory, that directory is a shared volume that you can find in the `dev/test/plugins` directory.
* `db` - this is an image that is providing the database for the installation. For performance and isolation reasons the database is **not** persisted across test runs and any data stored in the database will be lost when the container is stopped and removed.
* `cli` - this uses the `wordpress:cli` image to provide wp-cli commands for the stack.
* `adminer` - this provides a Web UI to check and control the stack database.
* `codeception` - this service contains the Codeception runner and support code, the image is a custom one adapted to WordPress usage.
* `chrome` - this image provides the Chrome instance that will run the acceptance tests requiring JavaScript support.

The `tric` command, and the interactive shell, will mostly interact and run commands into the `codeception` image.
