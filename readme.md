# Products Dev Environment (ALPHA)

This project is a TEC and Plugins meta repo. It was built as a wrapper for our products suite and serves two purposes:

1. A development environment for a quick start to contributing effectively
2. A CI environment for running testing across our entire suite of plugins

We recommend you work in whatever environment you wish, especially since many of our customers have variable stacks. But, this repo can get you up and running pronto with a few benefits:

1. WordPress codebase, configuration, and all required product suite dependencies
1. Every events plugin cloned and built
1. Testing configuration pre-configured
1. Docker-ized environment (optional)
